# LOGBOOK11
This logbook documents the work done for week 11 of the FSI course - [link to guide](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Crypto_PKI/Crypto_PKI.pdf).

## Setting up
To start, we need to setup the docker container. As we have done this many times before, we will skip this step.

We also need to add the following lines to our etc/hosts file:
```
10.9.0.80 www.bank32.com
10.9.0.80 www.smith2020.com
```
