# CVE-2021-34646

Versions of the Booster for WooCommerce WordPress plugin up to and including 5.4.3 have a security vulnerability related to authentication bypass. This vulnerability stems from a weakness in the random token generation process within the "reset_and_mail_activation_link" function. Exploiting this vulnerability enables malicious actors to impersonate users and trigger email address verification for arbitrary accounts, including those with administrative privileges. Consequently, attackers can automatically log in as the targeted user, including site administrators.

## CVE Explanation

## Attack step-by-step
To attack this vulnerability, all that is needed is to download the source code below. It is a python exploit that generates login tokens based on timestamps and constructs URLs that can potentially grant unauthorized access to the targeted WordPress site. To use the exploit, one must simply access the target websites REST API endpoint, as described in the source code, and retrieve user data, more specifically, their IDs.
Then, the hacker only needs to run the script with two parameters, the target website's URL and the desired user's ID, gaining access to the user's account.
