## Task 1: Manipulating Environment Variables

In this task, the goal was to confirm which are the envirnoment variables that exist.

```SHELL
printenv # we could also use env
```

(print do output)

Or, if we want, we could also use the command for checking one envirnoment variable specifically, in this example, we are using variable PWD as an example:

```SHELL
env PWD # we could also use printenv
```

(print do output)
